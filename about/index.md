Hi, my name is Daniel, and Iâ€™m a senior in Aalto university about to graduate. I have worked in a variety of jobs and my aim is to help frustrated Companies manage information. I am fascinated by the process flow of data to knowledge.

I am looking for opportunities that involve working with data and finding ways to create more value to consumers.

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll, and run using the ruby language. I have tried to develop a website using Django, but i am still on the learning curve with python. Main site design was done by olakara, a developer based in UAE.

The site uses Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

I enjoy the simplicity of information tiles that lead to more information based on user interest.

Technicals apart, this is my site where I plan to pen down my thoughts and professional  experiences that I would like to share. However, content and opinion you see here are personal and very subject to change. I set up this site with the comment section to encourage sharing of information, hopefully leading to learning.
