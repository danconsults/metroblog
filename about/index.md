Hi, my name is Daniel, and Iâ€™m a senior in Aalto university about to graduate. I have worked in a variety of jobs and my aim is to help frustrated Companies manage information. I am fascinated by the process flow of data to knowledge.

I am looking for opportunities that involve working with data and finding ways to create more value to consumers.

## About this Site

This site is mainly a repository for data projects and other issues related to information management. It contains some projects that i find interesting, and also provides me with an opportunity to learn about my hooby, web application development. 

Technically, this site is built using jekyll, a ruby-based site scaffold generator.
