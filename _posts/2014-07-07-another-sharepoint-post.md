Every business is a service business. 

For companies in the service sector, information equals direct competitive advantage. This explains why content providers record your preference for comedy over drama, or your hotel records your preference for a non-smoking place.

Currently, companies that have not traditionally thought of themselves as service providers are beginning to think differently. Does a car manufacturer sell cars or transportation services? If the latter, then it makes sense for the Auto-dealership to offer you a temporary car whenever your own is in the shop, (as many now do).

Even commodity products can be enhanced with service. A phone company that monitors your phone usage and sells you some airtime when you need it offers a better service than the companies that expect you to load your phone with air-time when you have completely run out.

The main differenciators in competitive advantage are the price and the service level. Most companies are wisely side-stepping price wars that are brought about by incresing technologies and efficiencies, in favour of charging more for better services.

yes. No matter what business you are in, you are primarilly dealing with services, and the more you consider your business from that angle, the more you shall be able to strategise.
